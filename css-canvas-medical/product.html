              <h2>It puts care at your command</h2>
              <p>You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or bounce around fie windows to discover the last blood count. Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your note, so you never have to leave it. And becauase Canvas learns from every interaction, it gets smarter with every patient you see.</p>

              <p><q>Canvas works three times as fast, improves performance dramatically on key quality metrics, and is incredibily easy to use. The right information is presented in the right way at the right time, and the product leverages technology to actually improve the quality of care I provide.</q></p>

            <p><q>Which of my uncontrolled diabetic patients haven't had a test in the past 3 months? Which of my patients are on potentially unsafe levels of opiods according to the most recent guidelines? That doesn't seem like a lot to ask and those are tremondously important questions. But I just couldn't get an answer from our old system! Canvas is light-years ahead.</q></p>

            <h2>It automates performance improvement</h2>
            <p>Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you understand performance, but they aren't enough to improve quality and increase revenue day after day. Canvas automates quality protocols and charge capture so clinicians can focus on more complex work only they can do.</p>
            <a href="#">Learn more about practice management and billing.</a>
            <p><q>With MIPS a reality and fee-for-service billing rules as complex as ever, to be honest I didn't know how we were going to keep up. We're a small practice and we don't have a big quality team or a group of coders to catch everything. The automation in Canvas has completely eliminated my concerns around quality and revenue performance.</q></p>
